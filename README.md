### OSX Framework for getting system informations  ![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-lightgreen.svg)
OS X (and partially iOS) framework for getting software and hardware informations (such as CPU vendor, RAM size, device model and serial, â€¦) at runtime. Relies on IOKit and SysCtl, as well as on the now-deprecated GestaltManager, for compatibility purposes only.

Here's what you can gather with PFSystemKit:
* CPU informations (vendor, nominal clock speed, caches size, core count, thread count, marketing name)
* RAM infos (size, usage statistics)
* GPU infos (matching framebuffer, model, ports)
* Device infos (device family (e.g. MacBook Pro), model (MacBookPro8,1), version (8,1), serial)
* Battery (voltage, current, serial, manufacturer, age in days, cycle count, temperature)

### Contributing (hehehe, who am I kidding)
Found a bug ? Want a feature ? Don't be shy, pull requests welcome !
Otherwise, just open an issue, I'll have a look.
Have a special request ? Contact me (via issue first) - depending on what it is, it may cost some bucks.

### Roadmap
* Better iOS support
* Cocoapods and Carthage support
* GPU informations enhancements
* Network details

### Story
I started building this library in early 2015, for a project of mine that is now paused - an OSX app providing deep insight on the system, both on hardware and software sides. I choosed to bring this library to a more mature state before continuing the original project, while I'll still be keeping PFSystemKit up-to-date.

### Licensing

>   0. Additional Definitions.
> 
>   As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
> General Public License.
> 
>   "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
> other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
> 
>   An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
> by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
> Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
> of using an interface provided by the Library.
> 
>   A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
> Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
> with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
> Version".
> 
>   The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
> Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
> for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
> based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
> 
>   The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
> object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
> and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
> Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
> 
>   1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
> 
>   You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
> without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
> 
>   2. Conveying Modified Versions.
> 
>   If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
> facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
> that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
> facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
> version:
> 
>    a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
>    ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
>    function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
>    whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
> 
>    b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
>    this License applicable to that copy.
> 
>   3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
> 
>   The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
> a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
> code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
> material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
> layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
> (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
> 
>    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
>    Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
>    covered by this License.
> 
>    b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
>    document.
> 
>   4. Combined Works.
> 
>   You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
> taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
> portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
> engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
> the following:
> 
>    a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
>    the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
>    covered by this License.
> 
>    b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
>    document.
> 
>    c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
>    execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
>    these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
>    copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
> 
>    d) Do one of the following:
> 
> 	   0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
> 	   License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
> 	   suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
> 	   recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
> 	   the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
> 	   manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
> 	   Corresponding Source.
> 
> 	   1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
> 	   Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
> 	   a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
> 	   system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
> 	   of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
> 	   Version.
> 
>    e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
>    be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
>    GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
>    necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
>    Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
>    Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
>    you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
>    the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
>    Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
>    Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
>    for conveying Corresponding Source.)
> 
>   5. Combined Libraries.
> 
>   You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
> Library side by side in a single library together with other library
> facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
> License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
> choice, if you do both of the following:
> 
>    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
>    on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
>    conveyed under the terms of this License.
> 
>    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
>    is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
>    accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
> 
>   6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
> 
>   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
> of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
> versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
> differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
> 
>   Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
> Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
> of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
> applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
> conditions either of that published version or of any later version
> published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
> received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
> General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
> General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
> 
>   If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
> whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
> apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
> permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
> Library.
